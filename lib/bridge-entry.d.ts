/**
 * Subagent Director — optional settings bridge plugin entry.
 *
 * This is a SEPARATE loader entry from the main `subagent-director` plugin
 * because the Host web server service is only reachable through cordis
 * `inject` — tree-external plugins cannot see it through `ctx.get()`
 * (verified: dsh-client-connection itself declares `inject = ["webServer"]`,
 * dsh-client-connection/lib/index.js:479, and a third-party plugin probing
 * ctx.get("webServer") never registers its routes).
 *
 * Load this entry in Web profiles alongside the main entry to enable the
 * "/subagent-director" settings bridge that bypasses the apiproxy
 * exposedNamespaces() allowlist. In headless profiles this entry simply never
 * activates (cordis inject waits for webServer, which is absent), so the main
 * entry keeps working there unchanged.
 *
 * Profile patch example (cordis.patch.yml):
 *   - insert:
 *       - id: subagent-director-bridge
 *         name: dsh-plugin-subagent-director/bridge
